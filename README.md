# Movement System & Dissolve Shader

## 📌 Overview  
This project features an **Advanced Movement System** built using **State Machines** and **Scriptable Objects** in Unity. It includes multiple movement states such as **Run, Jump, Stop, Idle, and Attacks**, providing smooth and dynamic character control. Additionally, the project implements a **Dissolve Shader**, allowing objects to gradually fade away with a visually appealing effect.
